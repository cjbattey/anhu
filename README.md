demographic and climate niche analysis of range expansions in the Anna's Hummingbird

guide to scripts: 
- hum_pop_models.R contains the core data preprocessing and demographic model fitting pipeline. 
- hull_map.R estimates the wintering range in different time periods and generates Figure 1.
- anhu_figs.R summarizes demographic model output for figure 2 and supplementary figures 1 - 8. 
- anhu_niche.R builds and compares niche models from historic occurrence and climate data and produces Figure 3. 
- phenology.R is the script used to analyze nesting times and generate Figure 4
- climate_data_prep.R summarizes PRISM data for use in niche models. 

other scripts are for making fun gifs and conducting exploratory analyses not included in the manuscript.
